            <a href="/index.html#about-me">

            </a>
          </p>
          <h3>
            Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey:
          </h3>
          <p>
            The core learning has enabled me to evaluate myself, and my core strengths and weaknesses as they have evolved throughout Foundations. 
            This has been essential to my learning process as I have been able to reflect on not just the skills I have which help me to succeed, but also recognise and change any habbits that may be causing blocks in my learning. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Core has taught me the soft skills which are sought after in the Tech industry, and how I can hone those skills to increase my chances of gaining a career as a developer. 
          </p>
          <h3>
            What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I have learned a few things, but the top three would be - 
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>It is important that I approach each day with intention, utilising the mediation tools from Foundations, and not harbouring negative thoughts. </li>
              <br>
              <li>Putting information in context is really valuable to my learning, to build those neural networks, I always want to make sure I see relationships between concepts.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Sometimes I switch between a growth and fixed mindset; it is important to recognise when I am exhibiting static behaviour, as I want to also be in the best zone for learning</li>
            </ol>
          <h3>
            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I suppose, how obvious, yet how undervalued it has been in my learning journey or any aspect of life up until now!
            I enjoyed the core learning, but was also surprised upon realising that once I had the knowledge and tools, they were actually really useful and I was able to start implementing them in my everyday life.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>I didn't find the core learning material too challening in itself, it was (and still is) in the implementation of it!
            In saying that, it is not difficult once you are aware of your habbits, strengths and weaknesses to utilise that knowledge and start making improvements.
            It is probably more to make a daily conscious effort to use the tools and knowledge. 
          </p>
          <h3>
            Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?
          </h3>
          <p>The more I practice and utilise the tools learned in Core, the easier they become to implement daily.
            They create solid mechanisms to deal with the blocks and challenges with learning technical aspects of the course, like JavaScript.
            Human skills are very important to develop, and should be widely taught.
